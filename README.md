OctaPitch is a guitar tuner created by Taylor Plambeck. It records audio and performs autocorrelation to find pitch. This pitch is what is used on the display to tune the guitar. This Git is to show example code and project setup, the fonts and background were not created by me. 

App or Art?

 OctaPitch combines a high standard for pitch recognition and an art style of unwavering mystique.  Seek counsel from the Octopus for any musical insight you may need.  Why not let your tuner inspire you?  
 
  OctaPitch comes with no ads, no loading screens, and no charge.  OctaPitch recognizes every note in the guitar frequency spectrum and offers preset tunings to choose from.  
  
  The elegance of OctaPitch transcends into its functionality as well.  The number on the display is the frequency heard by OctaPitch.  Above it is the note closest to that frequency.  The display guides you so the guitar is perfectly tuned to that note.  When the note belongs to a string in the chosen tuning, an indicator will turn orange next to the corresponding tuning peg.  You can use the Tuning Menu to change which group of notes are synced to the indicators on the pegs.   Because of the design on the artwork, there are no indicators for the 7th and 8th strings, but those notes can still be heard and tuned by OctaPitch.
